 * Normalize a CV file to PDF and optionally compress it.

 * V1 behavior:
 * - If the mime type is a supported image (`image/png`, `image/jpeg`, `image/jpg`),
 *   the image is decoded, optionally downscaled, recompressed as JPEG,
 *   and wrapped into a single-page PDF.
 * - If the mime type is `application/pdf`, the input is currently validated
 *   (must start with `%PDF-`) then returned unchanged. This is the hook where
 *   a real PDF optimization pipeline can be implemented later.
 * - For any other mime type, the input bytes are returned unchanged.
